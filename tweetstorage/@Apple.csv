2,lulu_19_09,"@GwenLovesMovies Look, of course there were/was bad Apples and some murky situations,as in all fandoms I might add... but These groups are violent and some of them neo fascists... it's outrageous to compare violence with fandom wars. Besides, lots of people from the movement are not even"

11,pilky,And there's another kernel panic as a result of turning a monitor off and on to fix the fact that @unity3d froze one of my monitors. Don't know whether to blame Apple or Unity or both.
12,anonymotalk,@Reuters NOW THAT'S A CRYING SHAME:  Somebody somewhere has been watching too much TV.  One bad apple out there smuggling human beings and ruining the reputation of those in the transportation industy.
13,timclarepoet,I can't stop thinking about the Lament Configuration from Hellraiser but instead of opening a portal that summons the cenobites if you twist the box a certain way it just starts leaking juice like pouring apple juice &amp; you're like oh shit &amp; your jeans are soaked &amp; it doesn't stop

18,scodaillest,Imagine planting a seed for a apple tree and only to find out much later the seed was for a oak tree. No edible fruits will be produced.  This is what it’s like to run into a relationship with someone’s representative without taking time to carefully examine what lies beneath.

23,kerri_may,@ev4i20 @Linda45789701 @smsmnr @jk_rowling You don’t have a valid point. You are comparing an reversible minor procedure that allows future fertility with an irreversible major operation that ends fertility forever. Apples and oranges

41,betterway16,"@Laurie9203 @FlossSays @MartinKulldorff @AllisterHeath @collateralglbl Sweden shut down a lot more than people think.

Complex, and hard to compare Apple to apples."
