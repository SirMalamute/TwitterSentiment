9,oitoxiss,"@skulldaisygimp @xRazorEXE @Minecraft How about not leaving it up to megacorporations to figure out if ""heck"" should be able to ban you forever. And, Microsoft doesn't even run the servers! They shouldn't moderate what isn't theirs."
10,newfnukem,@pesuhardar @purchase_jack @TheAshenLuca I'll believe Xbox release dates when I see it. Difference between Sony &amp; Microsoft is that I at least know the PS games usually are top tier while Xbox stuff is hit and miss.
11,senor_putin,@Nozhx88 How did Xbox lie about numbers when Microsoft never talks about the number of consoles they sold
